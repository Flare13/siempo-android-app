## Key Features:

### Notification Tempo
Get notifications batched at set intervals. On the half hour, top of the hour, or once a day like the mail. Select specific apps that may interrupt you.

### Screen Cover
Siempo can help you reduce app overuse with gentle nudges that reveal the amount of time spent in the app and offer healthier uses of screen time. 

### Enlightened Home Screen
Siempo replaces the stock Android home screen with a calmer, less distracting interface. More of a zen garden than a Times Square. Customize with a calm image.

### Intention Setting
From the home screen you can personalize a message you will see every time you unlock your phone. What would be skillful for you to read dozens of times per day?

### Tidy App Menus
Tiered menu system keeps your tools and favorites closer by, and your distracting apps further away. 

### Muted App Icons
Unbranded and greyscale app icons prevent you from getting sidetracked and accumulating cognitive load on the way in/out of your phone.

### App Scrambling
Randomize the location of your distracting apps to prevent unconscious opens and usage.
