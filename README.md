**What:** We are reimagining the design of screens to support mental health, wellbeing and human potential.

**Why**: This is an important problem of our time that is not being meaningfully addressed by the companies who have the resources to do so. They need projects like Siempo to lead innovation and add market pressure.

**How:** We recently pivoted to open source to invite passionate professionals who want to plug into this [humane tech](https:/http://humanetech.com/) movement.

# Current Goals
---------------------

### Android App 
Our near term priorities involve adding industry-standard launcher features and improving the existing feature set. This summer we plan on expanding functionality. Seeking *Android developers, designers, data analysts, and QA testers.*

### Browser Extension
We are in the process of [merging two great chrome extensions](https://github.com/Get-Siempo/siempo-browser-ext) and launching this Siempo product on desktop. Seeking *web developers and designers*.

### iOS App
We are in the exciting early stages of creating an iOS app. Seeking designers and developers to help us build this from scratch.


### And beyond
Don't see something here? Tell us about your superpowers and what you would like to work on. We need help overhauling our web presence, conducting user research, brainstorming future product direction, getting the word out and more. [**Sign up.**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-hqfeXyy8FcCCMX8CZHTRO54enZCf5TMY_ATzScbqaM/edit#responses)

We seek to experiment with new approaches to innovation, drawing inspiration from the bleeding edge of progressive business culture: collective intelligence, omni-win paradigm, metamodernism, Zebras Unite, Emergent Strategy, Transformative Technology, Conscious Capitalism, Conscious Leadership, feminine economy, design feeling, humane technology and more.
